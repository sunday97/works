# PicNic

PicNic is an organic typeface inhabiting a cloud of contextual ligatures and inclusive ligatures, substituting for the midpoint automatically. The inclusive ligatures are designed mainly for French. 
The shapes are inspired by the trajectory of a drop of water on an oilcloth, the shadows of the tree leaves on the fabric lying in the grass, the precise path that the ant takes to the watermelon. They attempt to translate the sensory experience of a picnic among friends.
This typeface will suit for all wild, poetic and bucolic explorers for their most adventurous excursions.
