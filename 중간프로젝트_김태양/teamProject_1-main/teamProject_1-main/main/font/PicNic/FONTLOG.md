FONTLOG for PicNic
-------------------

This file provides detailed information on the Demo font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Demo fonts
and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
--------------------------

PicNic is an organic typeface inhabiting a cloud of contextual ligatures and inclusive ligatures, substituting for the midpoint automatically. The inclusive ligatures are designed mainly for French. This ligature work is based on research by the ByeByeBinary collective. https://genderfluid.space/
The shapes are inspired by the trajectory of a drop of water on an oilcloth, the shadows of the tree leaves on the fabric lying in the grass, the precise path that the ant takes to the watermelon. They attempt to translate the sensory experience of a picnic among friends.
This typeface will suit for all wild, poetic and bucolic explorers for their most adventurous excursions.
